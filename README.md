# NumberTheoryCalculator
This is a collection of a few console based functions that offer some helpful results for Number Theory and C.S. applications.
There is the option to perform the euclidiean division algorithm on two integers, and it does provide the process so you can
use the result to create a Diophantine Equation if needed. You can also check primality of a number, it does it in a somewhat
computationally heavy way but does introduce a couple of optimizations using congruence classes. There is finally a binary converter
that does exactly what it says. You are also able to print all previous operations from that instance of running the program.
